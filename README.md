## Introduction

STOC'D is designed to assist traders in making informed decisions about credit spread strategies. It combines historical data analysis, options chain information, and advanced stochastic models to provide comprehensive insights into potential trades. As a Slack app, it allows users to easily access these powerful analytics tools directly from their Slack workspace.

## Features

- **Slack Integration**: Interact with STOC'D directly through Slack commands.
- **Options Data Analysis**: Fetches historical price data, options chains, and price statistics from the Tradier API.
- **Volatility Estimation**: Calculates volatility using various models, including Yang-Zhang, Rogers-Satchell, and Heston.
- **Stochastic Models**: Implements Black-Scholes-Merton, Heston, Merton, Kou, and CGMY models for option pricing and simulation.
- **Option Pricing**: Calculates option prices, Greeks, and implied volatility using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
- **Spread Identification**: Identifies potential Bull Put and Bear Call spread opportunities based on user-defined criteria.
- **Probability Calculation**: Estimates probability of profit using Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations with various stochastic models.
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculates Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and potential profit/loss for simulated price paths.
- **Scoring and Ranking**: Ranks spread opportunities based on a composite score considering multiple factors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bcdannyboy/STOC-D.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   go mod download
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```
   TRADIER_KEY=your_tradier_api_key_here
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=your_slack_app_token_here
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your_slack_bot_token_here
   ```

4. Build the application:

   ```
   go build -o stocd .
   ```

## Usage

Run the STOC'D Slack bot:

```
./stocd
```

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it in your Slack workspace using the following commands:

- `/help`: Display available commands and their usage.
- `/fcs <symbol> <indicator> <minDTE> <maxDTE> <minRoR> <RFR>`: Find credit spreads for a given symbol.

Example:
```
/fcs AAPL 1 14 30 0.175 0.0382
```

This command will analyze Apple (AAPL) options, looking for bull put spreads (indicator > 0) with 14-30 days to expiration, a minimum return on risk of 17.5%, and using a risk-free rate of 3.82%.

## Technical Details

### Computational Complexity

STOC'D employs various stochastic models and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate option prices, probabilities, and risks. The computational complexity depends on the number of simulations, time steps, and the complexity of the underlying stochastic processes.

An estimate of the computational requirements for the `fcs` command can be calculated as such:

`O(numExpirations * (avgStrikesPerExpiration)^2 * numProbabilisticModels * numVolatilityEstimates * numMaxSimulations * timeSteps)`

as you can see, the complexity is exponential in the number of parameters. To mitigate this, STOC'D implements parallel processing, batch processing, caching, and early simulation cut-off to optimize performance and resource usage.

### Data Fetching

- Utilizes the Tradier API to fetch historical price data, options chains, and price statistics.
- Implements functions to retrieve quotes, options expirations, and full options chains.

### Volatility Estimation

1. **Yang-Zhang Volatility**: Accounts for overnight jumps.
2. **Rogers-Satchell Volatility**: Independent of price drift.
3. **Local Volatility Surface**: Based on option prices across different strikes and expirations.
4. **Implied Volatility**: Calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
5. **Historical Volatility**: Computed from past price data.
6. **Heston Stochastic Volatility**: Uses mean-reverting stochastic volatility.

### Probabilistic Models

1. **Merton Jump Diffusion Model**: Incorporates price jumps.
2. **Kou Jump Diffusion Model**: Uses double exponential distribution for jump sizes.
3. **CGMY Model**: Implements a tempered stable process for jumps.

### Option Pricing

- Implements Black-Scholes-Merton formula for European option pricing.
- Calculates option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho).
- Computes implied volatility using numerical methods.

### Spread Identification

- Identifies potential Bull Put and Bear Call spread opportunities.
- Filters spreads based on Days to Expiration (DTE) and return on risk (ROR).

### Probability Calculation

- Performs Monte Carlo simulations using various stochastic models.
- Estimates probability of profit for identified spreads.
- Incorporates multiple volatility estimates and stochastic volatility.

### Risk Assessment

- Calculates Value at Risk (VaR) at 95% and 99% confidence levels.
- Computes Expected Shortfall (ES).
- Assesses risk based on Bid-Ask Spread and trading volume.

### Scoring and Ranking

- Implements a composite scoring system considering probability of profit, VaR, ES, Bid-Ask Spread, and trading volume.
- Normalizes and weights factors to create a balanced score.
- Ranks spread opportunities based on the composite score.
